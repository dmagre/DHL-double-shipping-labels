# DHL-double-shipping-labels
When printing DHL shipping labels on an old Windows 7 PC everything works fine. When printed from a modern PC (Windows 10) shipping labels are printed twice. This probably has to do with the speed of the PC. On an old PC (slow) the DHL-software works, on a modern PC (fast) it doesn't.
